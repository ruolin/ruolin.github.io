				<div class="post-item"> 
				This website is hosted on github with only html, css and Javascript. The template was originally found in <a href="http://yihui.name/">Xie 
				Yihui’s</a> website. Thank him and the guy behind these nice designs.  I like this kind of webpage designs, clean, 
				neat, not over-decorated

				<h3>Who Am I</h3>
				<div class="post-item"> 
				I am a Post-80s, Beijing-er. I have my B.S. in Computer Science at Lanzhou University. Then I found my interest in Bioinformatics.
				I define myself as a data analyst because most of time I use tools or write programs to pull out useful information from certain 
				type of data. Python is my favorite programming language now because it is faster than Perl and easier than C++. It has a relatively
				stringent rules on layouts. What I like Python most is its error info which makes debugging a whole lots of easier.
				I also use R for some scientific computing, modeling and simulation stuff. But I never consider it as a real programming language.
